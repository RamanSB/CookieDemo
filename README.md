A sample project that demonstrates how a cookie can be created by a server and stored on the client-side 
and can then be used in subsequent requests to the server to identify the user making the requests. 

I had created this project because during one of my other projects I had experienced a bug whereby the cookie was shown on the servers response header,
however the cookie was not being stored in the browser, so I had created a project in isolation to solve this issue.
